# TRAIN STATUS TRACKING
Tracking the status(Location name) of current and upcoming stations of a train by using its PNR number. By entering the train's PNR on the dedicated web based application, it displays the upcoming station/platform's name with their estimated reaching time. It can be very helpful for those who are not aware of the particular travelling location(s) before.
